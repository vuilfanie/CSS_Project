                    <p>South West coffee is a family owned roastery and store that began in 2023 as the world was recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. We are careful to only source from suppliers that we trust and we are confident that our products are fair trade and organic. We are located on 123 South West St. and we provide a welcoming and friendly atmosphere to all of our customers.</p>
